            <ol>
                <li><span>Definition of a computer:</span> A computer is an electronic device that processes and stores
                    data, performs calculations, and carries out various tasks based on instructions provided by the
                    user.</li>
                <li><span>Components of a computer system:</span> We will discuss the essential components of a computer
                    system, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input devices, and
                    output devices. Students will gain an understanding of how these components work together to enable
                    computer functionality.</li>
                <li><span>Types of computers:</span> We will explore different types of computers, such as desktop
                    computers, laptop computers, tablets, smartphones, and specialized devices like gaming consoles.
                    Students will learn about the unique features and purposes of each type of computer.</li>
                <li><span>Evolution of computers over time:</span> We will provide a brief historical overview of the
                    development of computers, from early mechanical devices to modern high-performance machines.
                    Students will gain insight into how computers have evolved and the impact they have had on various
                    fields.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Lesson 2: Computer Hardware</h3>
            <p>This lesson will focus on computer hardware components, their functions, and their roles within a
                computer system. Key topics covered include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</span> Students will learn about the CPU, often referred to as
                    the "brain" of the computer. We will discuss the CPU's role in executing instructions, performing
                    calculations, and managing data processing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Random Access Memory (RAM):</span> We will explore the purpose of RAM in a computer system.
                    Students will understand how RAM stores data temporarily, allowing the CPU to quickly access and
                    manipulate information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Storage devices:</span> Students will gain an understanding of different types of storage
                    devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). We will discuss the
                    differences between these storage technologies, including factors like speed, capacity, and
                    durability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Input and output devices:</span> We will cover various input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse,
                    touchpad) and output devices (e.g., monitor, printer, speakers). Students will learn how input
                    devices allow users to provide instructions or data to the computer, while output devices display or
                    present information processed by the computer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Expansion slots and cards:</span> This section will introduce expansion slots on the
                    motherboard, which allow for the addition of peripheral devices or expansion cards (e.g., graphics
                    cards, sound cards). Students will understand how these components can enhance a computer's
                    capabilities.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Lesson 3: Computer Software </h3>
            <p>In this lesson, we will explore the concept of computer software and its role in enabling different
                functionalities on a computer. Key topics covered include:</p>

                    <span>Difference between hardware and software:</span> Students will learn about the fundamental
                    distinction between hardware (physical components) and software (programs and instructions). We will
                    discuss how software interacts with hardware to perform specific tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Operating systems:</span> We will introduce the concept of an operating system (OS) as a
                    crucial software component that manages computer resources, provides a user interface, and enables
                    the execution of other software applications.
                </li>
                <li>
