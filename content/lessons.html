        <h1>Lesson 2: Computer Hardware</h1>
        <h3>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) </h3>
        <p>CPU is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It is a key component responsible for executing
            instructions and performing calculations, thereby enabling the computer to carry out various tasks.
            Here's an elaborate overview of the CPU and its Main Components:</p>
        <img src="images\Components.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Control Unit (CU)</h3>
        <p>
            The Control Unit is responsible for managing and coordinating the operations of the CPU. Its primary tasks
            include fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and controlling the flow of data within the CPU
            and between other computer components. The CU sends control signals to various components to initiate
            specific operations.
        </p>
        <h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
        <p>
            The Arithmetic Logic Unit is responsible for performing arithmetic calculations and logical operations. It
            can execute basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
            Additionally, the ALU performs logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, which are fundamental for
            decision-making and data manipulation.
        </p>
        <h3>Registers</h3>
        <p>
            Registers are small, high-speed storage units located inside the CPU. They are used for temporary storage of
            data, instructions, and memory addresses. Registers enable quick access to frequently used information,
            reducing the need to fetch data from slower memory locations. Common types of registers include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Accumulator:</span> It stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
            <li><span>Program Counter (PC):</span> It keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction to be
                fetched.</li>
            <li><span>Instruction Register (IR):</span> It holds the currently fetched instruction.</li>
            <li><span>Memory Address Register (MAR):</span> It stores the memory address being accessed.</li>
            <li><span>Memory Data Register (MDR):</span> It temporarily holds data fetched from or written to memory.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cache Memory</h3>
        <p>
            Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory integrated within or near the CPU. It acts as a buffer between
            the CPU and the main memory (RAM). Cache memory stores frequently accessed instructions and data, allowing
            for faster retrieval and execution. It helps bridge the speed gap between the CPU and RAM, which can
            significantly improve overall system performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            CPU cache is organized into multiple levels:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Level 1 (L1) cache:</span> The closest and fastest cache to the CPU, split into instruction cache
                (L1i) and data cache (L1d).</li>
            <li><span>Level 2 (L2) cache:</span> A larger cache that follows the L1 cache and is slower but still faster
                than the main memory.</li>
            <li><span>Level 3 (L3) cache:</span> Present in some CPUs, it is larger but slower than L2 cache. It serves
                as a shared cache for multiple cores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The cache operates based on the principle of locality, exploiting the fact that programs tend to access
            nearby instructions and data.
        </p>
        <p>These components work together to facilitate the execution of instructions and data processing within the
            CPU. The Control Unit orchestrates the flow of operations, the ALU performs calculations and logical
            operations, the registers provide temporary storage, and the cache memory optimizes data access for improved
            performance.</p>
        <h3>Buses</h3>
        <p>
            Buses are communication pathways that enable the transfer of data and control signals between various
            components of the CPU and the rest of the computer system. They are crucial for the coordination and
            synchronization of operations. Here are the three main types of buses found in a CPU:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Data Bus:</span> The data bus carries data between the CPU and other components, such as memory,
                input/output devices, and cache. It is bi-directional, allowing data to be transferred in both
                directions.</li>
            <li><span>Address Bus:</span> The address bus carries memory addresses, indicating the location in memory
                from where data is to be fetched or stored. The size of the address bus determines the maximum amount of
                memory that can be accessed.</li>
            <li><span>Control Bus:</span> The control bus carries control signals that govern the operations of various
                components within the CPU and the computer system. These signals include commands for reading or writing
                data, interrupt requests, and timing signals.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Buses are typically characterized by their width, measured in bits, which determines the number of lines
            available for data transfer. For example, a 64-bit bus can transfer 64 bits of data simultaneously.
        </p>
        <h3>Clock</h3>
        <p>
            The clock is a fundamental component of a CPU's internal operations. It generates regular electronic pulses,
            known as clock cycles or clock ticks, which synchronize the activities of the CPU and other components. The
            clock acts as a timing mechanism, ensuring that operations occur in a coordinated and orderly manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clock speed, measured in Hertz (Hz), represents the number of clock cycles a CPU can execute per second.
            It determines the speed at which instructions are processed and calculations are performed. For example, a
            CPU with a clock speed of 3.5 GHz can execute 3.5 billion clock cycles per second.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each clock cycle is divided into smaller increments, and different operations within the CPU are
            synchronized to specific phases of the clock cycle. These phases include fetch, decode, execute, and store
            (as described earlier). The duration of a clock cycle is inversely proportional to the clock speed, so
            higher clock speeds generally result in faster processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's worth noting that the clock speed alone does not determine overall performance. Other factors, such as
            the efficiency of the CPU's microarchitecture, the number of cores, cache sizes, and the nature of the tasks
            being performed, also influence the CPU's performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overclocking, as mentioned earlier, involves running a CPU at a higher clock speed than its default
            specifications. It can potentially boost performance, but it may also lead to increased heat generation and
            stability issues, requiring appropriate cooling and careful consideration.
        </p>
        <p>The buses and the clock work together to facilitate the transfer of data and control signals within the CPU
            and between the CPU and other system components. The buses provide pathways for data and address transfer,
            while the clock ensures synchronized and timely execution of instructions and operations.</p>
