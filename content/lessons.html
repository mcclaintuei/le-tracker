        <h1>Lesson 2: Computer Hardware</h1>
        <h3>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) </h3>
        <p>CPU is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It is a key component responsible for executing
            instructions and performing calculations, thereby enabling the computer to carry out various tasks.
            Here's an elaborate overview of the CPU and its essential aspects:</p>
        <h3>Control Unit (CU)</h3>
        <p>
            The Control Unit is responsible for managing and coordinating the operations of the CPU. Its primary tasks
            include fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and controlling the flow of data within the CPU
            and between other computer components. The CU sends control signals to various components to initiate
            specific operations.
        </p>
        <h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
        <p>
            The Arithmetic Logic Unit is responsible for performing arithmetic calculations and logical operations. It
            can execute basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
            Additionally, the ALU performs logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, which are fundamental for
            decision-making and data manipulation.
        </p>
        <h3>Registers</h3>
        <p>
            Registers are small, high-speed storage units located inside the CPU. They are used for temporary storage of
            data, instructions, and memory addresses. Registers enable quick access to frequently used information,
            reducing the need to fetch data from slower memory locations. Common types of registers include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Accumulator:</span> It stores the results of arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
            <li><span>Program Counter (PC):</span> It keeps track of the memory address of the next instruction to be
                fetched.</li>
            <li><span>Instruction Register (IR):</span> It holds the currently fetched instruction.</li>
            <li><span>Memory Address Register (MAR):</span> It stores the memory address being accessed.</li>
            <li><span>Memory Data Register (MDR):</span> It temporarily holds data fetched from or written to memory.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cache Memory</h3>
        <p>
            Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory integrated within or near the CPU. It acts as a buffer between
            the CPU and the main memory (RAM). Cache memory stores frequently accessed instructions and data, allowing
            for faster retrieval and execution. It helps bridge the speed gap between the CPU and RAM, which can
            significantly improve overall system performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            CPU cache is organized into multiple levels:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Level 1 (L1) cache:</span> The closest and fastest cache to the CPU, split into instruction cache
                (L1i) and data cache (L1d).</li>
            <li><span>Level 2 (L2) cache:</span> A larger cache that follows the L1 cache and is slower but still faster
                than the main memory.</li>
            <li><span>Level 3 (L3) cache:</span> Present in some CPUs, it is larger but slower than L2 cache. It serves
                as a shared cache for multiple cores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The cache operates based on the principle of locality, exploiting the fact that programs tend to access
            nearby instructions and data.
        </p>
        <p>These components work together to facilitate the execution of instructions and data processing within the
            CPU. The Control Unit orchestrates the flow of operations, the ALU performs calculations and logical
            operations, the registers provide temporary storage, and the cache memory optimizes data access for improved
            performance.</p>
